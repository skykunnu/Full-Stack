<!-- CSS Selectors selects the HTML elements you want to style. -->


    <!-- 
    1. Simple Selectors - name,id,class selectors 
    
    -> One page, one id, one time.
    
    -> One page, one class, as many times. 
    
    -> A single tag can have atmost one id.
  
    -> A single tag can have as many classes.
    
    -> Id always take priority over classes. 

    ex-  #H1{
        background-color: bisque;
      }

    
      2. Attribute Selector - It matches elements based on the element having a given attribute. 
      
      ex- <h1> elements with name attribute as Shikhar.  

       h1[name='Shikhar']{
        color: magenta;
      }
      
      3. Combinators Selector - Space, >, ~ , + 

      space and > are child selectors

      ~ and + are sibling selectors
      
      # Space -  
      
     Ex-  div h1{
        color: yellow;
      }

      # >(child combinator)-

      Ex- select all those p elements who are immediate child of div element.  
      
      div>p{
        color: blueviolet;
      }


      # + (sibling combinator)- select all those span who are immediate sibling of div element. 

      Ex- first span element will be turned red.  
      
      div + span{
        color: red;
      }


      # ~ (tild combinator)- select all those span who are sibling of div element and are coming after it only not before it. 


      Ex- All span element coming after div will be turned blue. 
        div~span{
        color: blue;
      }
