    <title>HTML 5 Tags (Semantic tags)</title>
</head>
<body>


<!-- HTML and HTML 5 have only one difference that is Semantic tags.  -->

    
    <!-- All semantic elements are equivalent to div tag

     Semantic tags do not have any special effect on website design, but are
     very important for better SEO of the website because search engines ranks up the websites
     having higher semantic tags than those with only divs.

    -->
    <!-- 

    Semantic tags create Landmarks and Sectioning. 

    Screen Readers are assistive technologies that help people with visual impairments
    or blindness interact with digital content. 


    1. Landmarks- End User (Screen Readers) 


    2. Sectioning- (Search Engines + Screen Readers)


    # What is the problem with <div>

    -> Below are the following problems of the div tag
    
    * It's too generic, does not have any meaning.
    * Does not create any landmark. 
    * Does not create any sectioning of your webpage. 


    Note:- Semantic elements are for 2 things. Document Outline and for Landmarks.
    We have to use them in less quantity. Divs are the real boss. 

    
    // Semantic Tags:-

    1. main:- <main>Content</main>, It holds your webpage most 
    ------------
    prominent content. At one time, only one main tag is allowed. 
    
    2. nav:- used to wrap in page navigation (internal navigation on 
     ------------
    the same page) or outside page navigation (external navigation means going to different page).

    -> You can have multiple navs. In that case use aria-label  to name different navs. 
    <nav aria-label="Primary"><a href="23">Sample 1</a></nav>
<nav aria-label="Secondary"><a href="2343">Sample 2</a></nav>

    3. aside tag:- The element defines some content aside(bagal me) 
     ------------
    from the content it is placed in. 
   
    -> This tag is used in html to define content that is indirectly related to the main content. 
    -> It is often used for sidebar, Advertisements, Author-bio sections. 
    -> requires a aria-label if you have multiple tag.
    -> Avoid it having in main. 

    # It is not necessary to place aside only on the side. you can position it anywhere on the screen, including the middle, top, or bottom. 


    4. Header tag- It represents a container for introductory content 
     ------------
    or set of navigational links. 

    -> It typically contains logo, search bar or one more heading element. 

    -> According to official doc you should have one header in the entire html doc. 


    5. Footer tag- It defines a footer for a doc & section.
     ------------
    -> It typically contains copyright info, back to top links, related doc. 

    -> According to official doc you should have one footer in the entire html doc. 



    6. Section tag- defines a section of document or logical grouping 
    --------------
    of content within document. 

    -> It has 2 purpose:-

    # To create a landmark.
    #  To create branches and outline. 

    -> If you want to create a landmark using section tag than use aria-label with section tag. 

    -> H1 inside section is treated as name of the branch. 


    
    7. article tag - It represent one single unit and work 
    ---------------
    independently. 

    -> It is used in blogs, comments, News article and so on. 
    -> Unlike sections, article can have its own header and footer. 


    8. figure tag 
    ------------------
    -> The main role of figure tag is to semantically associate media (like image) with its caption using <figcaption> tag. 

    -> both figcaption and figuretag are used together. 

    9. details/ summary tag - It is similar to expand and collapse 
    -------------------------
    functionality means when you click on the arrow beside FAQ then all 4 divs will be visible. 

    <details>
    <summary>FAQ</summary>
    <div>1. HTML</div>
    <div>2. CSS</div>
    <div>3. Shikhar</div>
    <div>4. Shikhar</div>
    </details>

    10. time tag -> if you want to show any time related info in your webpage then use time tag. 

    11. <address> tag -> It is used to represent the contact info.
