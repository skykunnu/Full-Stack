<!-- HTML and HTML 5 have only one difference that is Semantic tags.  -->

    
    <!-- All semantic elements are equivalent to div tag

     Semantic tags do not have any special effect on website design, but are
     very important for better SEO of the website because search engines ranks up the websites
     having higher semantic tags than those with only divs.

    Screen Readers are assistive technologies that help people with visual impairments
    or blindness interact with digital content. 


    1. Landmarks- End User (Screen Readers) 


    2. Sectioning- (Search Engines + Screen Readers)


    # What is the problem with <div>

    -> Below are the following problems of the div tag
    
    * It's too generic, does not have any meaning.
    * Does not create any landmark. 
    * Does not create any sectioning of your webpage. 


    Note:- Semantic elements are for 2 things. Document Outline and for Landmarks.
    We have to use them in less quantity. Divs are the real boss. 

    
    // Semantic Tags:-

    1. main:- <main>Content</main>, It holds your webpage most prominent content. At one time, only one main tag is allowed. 
    
    2. nav:- used to wrap in page navigation (internal navigation on the same page) or outside page navigation (external navigation means going to different page).

    -> You can have multiple navs. In that case use aria-labelledBy to name different navs.

<nav></nav>























 <!-- Below is the way to link input tag with datalist tag by giving list attribute to input and id attribute to datalist having the same value.  -->

 <!-- <input list="car" placeholder="enter car brand" name="brand">
 <datalist id="car">
  <option value="mercedes"></option>
  <option value="maruti"></option>
  <option value="masserati"></option>
  <option value="Bentley"></option>
  <option value="Honda"></option>
  <option value="Hyundai"></option>
  <option value="BMW"></option>
  <option value="Audi"></option>
</datalist>
 -->



 <!-- Audio (mp3 and ogg are the only extensions supported by html5) and video(mp4 and ogg) tag. -->

 <!-- With controls you will be able to play pause the audio and control the volume.and with autoplay audio and video will automatically play
 some attributes like 
 loop-> off(default),on 
 muted-> In muted form also audio and video will work.
 -->
 <audio src="audio.mp3" controls autoplay muted></audio>
 <video src="video.mp4" controls width="520px" height="520px" autoplay muted></video>
