# 4 ways to write CSS

-> by using style tag under head tag.
-> by writing inline css inside the html elements. <h1 style='color:black'></h1>
-> by using @import(external css file path name along with extension)

# CSS Selectors

# CSS Positions

> Static - By default, disabled stacking (Z-index)

> Relative - relative to elements current positioning, enables stacking (z-index).

> Absolute - It works well along with relative position, without relative positioning happens wrt body otherwise parent element has relative postion and child has absolute position, enables stacking (z-index). 

> Fixed -  It creates a new layer and positioning happens wrt body.

> Sticky - 

# inline elements do not accept height and width CSS properties.
