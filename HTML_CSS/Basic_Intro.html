<!-- HTML - Hypertext Markup Language, Hypertext means text made up of links, markup means language made up of tags 
 In initial days HTML purpose was for documentation.

HTML is a case insensitive language (Both smallcase and uppercase letters are treated equal.)

HTML is a text file which contains tags that eventually makes an UI. 

HTML is a very forgiving langauge. it will render the wrong tags as well as text also.  

# To validate your html use HTML Validator tool. 


# 4 reasons to write HTML 

1. HTML provides the foundational structure for web pages. 
2. HTML is a standard markup language for the web, supported by all browsers. 
3. HTML serves as the backbone for adding interactive features via integration of CSS(for styling) and Javascript(for functionality). 
4. Writing HTML with semantic tags ensures content is accessible to screen readers & search engines. 

# Format of HTML Page

-> HTML Version
-> Head- Configuration
-> Body- Content



-->
<!--

# HTML Version

If you didn't include <!DOCTYPE html> in your html file then the mode of your browser changes into quirks mode. 
# HTML Version

Open the console and typeÂ console.log(document.compatMode): if output is CSS1Compat means the Doctype html is included and if output is BackCompat means the Doctype html is not included. 

1. CSS1Compat=Standard mode (if doctype html is included), Most modern website use this mode, It ensures proper layout and styling according to W3C spec.  

2. BackCompat=Quirks mode  (if doctype html is not included), Used mainly for backward compatibility with old websites. 

The CSS1 and Back compat mode refers to document modes in web browser, which affects how a webpage is rendered. 

3. Visual issues : Spacing/Font size inconsistencies. 

4. Javascript issues : document.body.clientHeight (It gives you the height of the <body> elements content area).

5. Semantic elements lose their meaning.


# Head-Configuration (Brain of HTML Doc)

1. title - basically adds the title to the html doc. 

2. base - the base tag in the head section of html doc sets a default URL that all relative URLs(such as links, images, stylesheets and script) will follow, not the absolute URLs like(https://google.com).

 base tag takes two attributes href and target. target attri means where to open the linked document default value is _self(opens in the same tab) _blank means opens the link in different tab.

 Always include href in order to work with base tag. 

 base tag is unique in a html doc. 


# how base URL works

1. Example without <base>

<a href="about.html">About us <a>

If the current page URL is https://example.com/products/index.html, clicking "About Us" will navigate to:
âž¡ https://example.com/products/about.html (relative to the current page)


2. Example with <base>

<base href="https://example.com/">

<a href="about.html">About us <a>

    on clicking "About us" it will navigate to  âž¡ https://example.com/about.html (relative to the base url.)


3. style - With the help of style tag we can write css for our html doc. 


4. meta - It is a very powerful tag in the entire html file.

With the meta tag we can tell the browser about the webpage and also how to manage this webpage in different-different devices(ie mobile, laptop and so on). 

With the help of meta tag we can provide some information to search engine so that they can show it in search results.  

Ex-
  <meta name="title" content="This is my fancy web page" />
  <meta name="description" content="About your fancy web page." />



5. Link tag -> it is used to link an external file with the html doc. 


for ex- <link rel="stylesheet" href="path of external css file.">

<link rel='icon' href='fav.png' />

for ex- if you want to add icon to your webpage, you can do so without explicitly adding it in the html doc by simply making favicon.ico file inside the root directory because browsers now days become really smart that they  automatically find the favicon.ico and make the icon of it for your webpage. 


6. Script tag -> This tag is used to write javascript inside the html doc. it can be used inside head tag or body tag. 


# body tag ->  This is a tag where we write all the content, images and so on, which we want to display on the brwoser. 




# 3 Mandatory things that make your HTML page a valid page

-> DOCTYPE Declaration

-> HTML, head & body tag

-> Character Encoding Declaration utf-8 and lang attribute in html tag which tells you about the language of the html doc. en-english

<meta charset="UTF-8"> tag is an HTML element that specifies the character encoding for your webpage. character encoding defines how characters (letter, numbers, symbols) are represented in binary code so that browsers can display them correctly.

UTF-8 is a widely used encoding standard that supports huge range of characters including emoji international alphabets and symbols. 

Imagine your webpage has this text: "I love piÃ±atas! ðŸŽ‰"

With <meta charset="UTF-8">: The browser renders it perfectly as "I love piÃ±atas! ðŸŽ‰".
Without it: If the browser defaults to ISO-8859-1, you might see "I love piÃƒÂ±atas! Ã°Å¸Å½â€°" or even replacement characters like "I love pi?atas! ?"
