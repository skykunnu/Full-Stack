// Execution Context - It is a conceptual environment created by the js engine to manage the execution of code. it contains all the necessary info to execute code, such as variable and function references, scoping rules and the value of this. 

// It's a area in memory where code gets executed.

// Js code is executed in two phase:- 

// 1. compilation, memory allocation, parsing, scope setting phase.
