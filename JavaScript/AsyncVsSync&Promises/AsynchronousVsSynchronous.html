    <!-- Asynchronous Vs Synchronous -->
<script>

// Javascript is a single thread language, meaning it has only one call stack and one execution thread to process code at a time.

// In Javascript all the asynchronous tasks like (setTimeout, fetch and so on) are done with the help of browser. 


/* Synchronous means the code runs in a particular sequence of instruction given in the program. 
Each instruction(code) waits for the previous instruction(code) to complete its execution. */


console.log('First'); // First
console.log('Second'); // Second
console.log('Third'); // Third


/* Asynchronous code execution allows the execution of the upcoming instructions immediately*/


console.log('First'); 

setTimeout(() => console.log('Second'), 2000); 

console.log('Third');

/* Order of above program is 
First
Third
Second (due to delay of 2sec).
