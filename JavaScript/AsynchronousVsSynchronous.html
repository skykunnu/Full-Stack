// JavaScript is the synchronous single-threaded language but with the help of event loop and promises. JS is used to do asynchronous programming.


/* Synchronous means the code runs in a particular sequence of instruction given in the program. 
Each instruction waits for the previous instruction to complete its execution. */


console.log('First'); // First
console.log('Second'); // Second
console.log('Third'); // Third


/* Asynchronous code execution allows the execution of the upcoming instructions immediately*/


console.log('First'); 

setTimeout(() => console.log('Second'), 2000); 

console.log('Third');

/* Order of above program is 
First
Third
Second (due to delay of 2sec).
