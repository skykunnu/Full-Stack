        age=20; // It is a global variable defined in the global scope as it was not defined with any variable keyword. so, therefore it's a global variable. 
        console.log(age) //20

      // Let can be re-assign, is block scoped (It can be accessed inside block only) but cannot be re-declare.

// ⁡⁣⁣⁢Scope of a variable -> It is a place or an area upto which a variable is accessible. ⁡

/* ⁡⁣⁢⁣In JavaScript, we have three scopes global scope, function scope, and block scope.⁡ 

-> JS has function-level scoping  

# ⁡⁢⁣⁣The variable declared with var is global-scoped and function-scoped, meaning
that if we create a variable inside of a function it will not be accessible outside the function. 
⁡

# ⁡⁣⁢⁣The variable declared with let & const are function-scoped but at the same time, they are block-scoped. 
This means that in a block of code consisting of curly braces. eg-> loops , if-else statments etc.
they are not accessible outside the block.   ⁡

*/

// ⁡⁢⁣⁣Variable Shadowing⁡

/* 
⁡⁣⁣⁢It is a concept in js when a variable with the same name is declared in an inner scope
as well as in an outer scope. Any references to the variable within the inner scope
will refer to the inner variable, effectively shadowing the outer variable. ⁡

*/

let fruit='Apple';

function chooseFruit(){
    let fruit="Orange";
    console.log(fruit);
}

chooseFruit(); // Orange
console.log(fruit); // apple

/* 
⁡⁣⁣⁢The inner scope variable shadowed (override) the outer scope variable. 
The priority of scopes goes from inner-most to outer-most scope. 
That is why, the variables inside the function are prioritized and
then when the function ends, they are gone from the memory. 

same applies to block scope. 

If you create a variable in an outer scope with the let keyword and another variable with the var keyword in a block scope but with the same name, it will throw an error. This is called illegal shadowing because var is not block scoped and redeclaration of variable is not allowed in ⁡⁣⁣⁢var⁡ ⁡⁣⁣⁢but vice-versa is possible⁡⁡⁣⁣⁢.⁡

let a=10;
{
    var a=30;
    console.log(a); // Syntax error : Indentifier a is already been declared.
