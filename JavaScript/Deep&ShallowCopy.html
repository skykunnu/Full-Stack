      // There are two ways to create a copy of an object:-

      /* ⁡⁣⁣⁢Deep Copy - It is a copy of an object whose properties do not share the same reference as that of the source object from 
which the copy was made. As a result changes in either of them does not affect other.⁡ 
*/

      /* ⁡⁢⁣⁣Shallow Copy - It is a copy of an object whose properties share the same reference as that of the source object from
  which the copy was made. As a result changes in either of them affect both original object & copied object. ⁡
*/

      const foodItems = {
        food1: "Pasta",
        food2: "Pizza",
        food3: "Chowmein",
        food4: "Lassi",
      };

      let anotherFood = foodItems; // copying(refrencing) of object(foodItems) into new variable.

      // anotherFood.food1="Panner Tikka"

      // console.log(anotherFood.food1) // Panner Tikka
      // console.log(foodItems.food1) // Panner Tikka

      /* Why both of them have same values? because both new & old variables are pointing to same memory location, That means changing of values in any of them will reflect in both. */

      // hence In above example we actually made a shallow copy.

      // ⁡⁡⁣⁣⁢Below methods creates Shallow copy.⁡

      /*
   // ⁡⁣⁢⁣Object's Method:-
   
   1. Spread operator
   2. Object.assign()
   ⁡
   // ⁡⁢⁣⁣Array's Method:-
   
   1. Spread Operator
   2. Array functions (Map,reduce,filter)
   3. Array.slice()⁡
   
   but a problem arises in both the above methods is when we try to copy nested object into a new variable , since the nested object inside an object will not 
   copied, since they are only references. hence you would end up doing (SHALLOW COPY).
   
   */

      // ⁡⁣⁣⁢To avoid the shallow copy and to make a deep copies of nested objects and nested arrays use below method. ⁡

      /* 
# ⁡⁢⁣⁣Deep copy methods of Arrays⁡ ⁡⁢⁣⁣& Object⁡


1. ⁡⁣⁣⁢Using JSON.parse(JSON.stringify())⁡

Ex-

const obj = [
        {
          name: "John",
          hobbies: ["reading", "music"],
        },
        {
          name: "Sam",
          hobbies: ["music", "sport"],
        },
      ];


const newObj=JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj));

newObj[0].name='Rishi';
newObj[1].hobbies[0]='Gardening';


console.log(obj[0].name); // John
console.log(obj[1].hobbies[0]); // music

console.log(newObj[0].name); // Rishi
console.log(newObj[1].hobbies[0]); // Gardening

Original & new object are independent to each other even in the nested array case. hence this shows that deep copy is performed on the array. 

⁡⁣⁣⁢2. Using Recursive function⁡ 

Recursively copies every element of the array including nested array & object

function DeepCopyArray(objArr){
return objArr.map((item)=>{ // the map method returns a new array where each element is transformed based on the logic. 
    if(Array.isArray(item)){
        return DeepCopyArray(item);
    }
    else if(item && typeof item === "object"){
        return DeepCopyObject(item);
    }
    else {
      return item;
    }
})
}

function DeepCopyObject(obj){
  /* calls the reduce method on array (keys of obj) to iterate through the keys (property's name) and construct a new object. for ex keys:- [a,b] */
    return Object.keys(obj).reduce((copy,key)=>{ 
        copy[key]=DeepCopyArray([obj[key]])[0]
 /* {}[a]=DeepCopyArray([obj[a]])[0] -> takes the value of obj[a] and wraps it in an array and calls DeepCopyArray on this element and recursively deep copy the property value. 
extracts the deep copied value from the returned array using [0].  */
    },{})

const objArr=[1,[2,3],{a:4, b:[5,6]}];
const newObj=DeepCopyArray(objArr);
