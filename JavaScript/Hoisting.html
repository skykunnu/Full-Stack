    // Hoisting- It is a feature in js, where variable and function declarations are moved into the top of their containing scope. 

/* Only possible in case of Regular Function Declaration, Not possible in case of function Expression & Arrow functions */


/* In case of variable declared with var will give undefined if accessed before initialization.
   In case of variable declared with let and const will give ReferencedError if accessed before initialization-> this is 
   because they are in temporal dead zone (TDZ is an area of a block where variable is inacessible untill computer completely initializes it with a value.)  
*/
// In order to avoid hoisiting use Strict at the top of the editor. 

        // console.log(x); // undefined, variable is declared but not assigned value. 
        // var x = 5;
        //  function innerScope() {
        //      var x = 10;
        //      console.log(x); // 10 
        //  }
        //  console.log(x); // 5 
        //  innerScope();
