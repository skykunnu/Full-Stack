    // ⁡⁣⁣⁢Hoisting- It is a feature in js, where variable and function declarations are moved into the top of their containing scope.⁡⁡
    // Between function and variable declaration function has higher priority than variable.  

/* ⁡⁢⁣⁣Only possible in case of Regular Function Declaration, Not possible in case of function Expression & Arrow functions⁡ */


/*⁡⁣⁢⁣ In case of variable declared with var will give undefined if accessed before initialization.
   In case of variable declared with let and const will give ReferencedError if accessed before initialization-> this is 
   because they are in temporal dead zone (TDZ is an area of a block where variable is inacessible untill computer completely initializes it with a value.) ⁡ 
*/
// In order to avoid hoisiting use Strict at the top of the editor. 

        // console.log(x); // undefined, variable is declared but not assigned value. 
        // var x = 5;
        //  function innerScope() {
        //      var x = 10;
        //      console.log(x); // 10 
        //  }
        //  console.log(x); // 5 
        //  innerScope(); // 10


       function foo() {
            console.log(a);
            var a = 1;
            function a() { }
            console.log(a);

        function foo() {
            // Hoisting of function declaration 'a'
            function a() { }
            
            // Hoisting of variable declaration 'var a'
            var a;
            
            console.log(a);     // Logs: function a() { }
            a = 1;              // Variable assignment
            console.log(a);     // Logs: 1
        }
        
        // Explanation 
        /* 
       
       1> function declaration takes precedence over variable declaration during hoisting 
        because function declaration are more complete unit of functionality containing 
        both name and implementation while the variable declaration are just placeholder 
        untill value's are assigned to them. 

       2> when the first console.log(a) executes it prints the function defination becoz 
       a references to the function at that point. 

       3> then assignment a=1 executes, which overwrites the function reference with number 1. 

       4> Finally second console.log(a) executes it prints 1, since a now holds that value.
