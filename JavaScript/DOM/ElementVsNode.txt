// Difference between the Element and Node. 

> Element is a specific type of node that represents an HTML element. While all elements are nodes, not all nodes are element.

> Nodes are everything in the DOM. a node can be an element, attribute, text, comment and so on. Nodes are organized like a tree structure, with the document node at the top and all other nodes branching off from it.
