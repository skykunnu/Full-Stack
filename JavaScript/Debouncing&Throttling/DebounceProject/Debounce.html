// Debouncing is a technique used in programming to limit the rate at which a function is executed. It ensures that a function is only called after a certain amount of time has passed since its last invocation,


// It limits the execution of a function call and waits for a certain amount of time before running it again. 
// It helps us optimize how we call certain events.  


const input=document.querySelector('input');
input.addEventListener('keyup',debounce(hello,1000));

function debounce(func,delay){
let timer;
return (...args)=>{   // rest operator is used (collecting all the arguments), did this to take value from the input 

    clearTimeout(timer);
    timer=setTimeout(()=>{
        func(...args); // spread operator is used. (distributing all the arguments), did this to take value from the input
    },delay)
}
}

// Before spread & rest operators, passing arguments to the closure was done using bind & apply. 



function hello(e){
    console.log('Hello '+e.target.value);
