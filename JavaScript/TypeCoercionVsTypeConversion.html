// Type Coercion 

/* 
It is the automatic or implicit conversion of a value from one data type to another by js. 

-> The JavaScript engine decides to perform the conversion based on the context of the operation.

-> Occurs during operations like comparisons (==), arithmetic operations (+, -, etc.), or logical operations.

*/

// Type Conversion 

/* 
-> It is the explicit conversion of a value from one data type to another by the developer.

->  The developer explicitly uses methods like Number(), String(), Boolean(), etc.
