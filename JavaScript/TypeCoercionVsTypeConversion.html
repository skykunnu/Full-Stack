// Js loves Numbers. 

// Type Coercion (Implicit conversion)

/* 
It is the automatic or implicit conversion of a value from one data type to another by js. 

-> The JavaScript engine decides to perform the conversion based on the context of the operation.

-> Occurs during operations like comparisons (==), arithmetic operations (+, -, etc.), or logical operations.

// Rules

1. if both are primitive data types then convert it to a number. 

2. if not then first convert it to string and then convert to number.

3. if you try to convert incompatible data types such as 1-{}, in such case you will get NaN. 

*/

console.log(2+"2") // 22, Type coercion took place where number(2) converts to string and then concatination occurs. 
console.log(1+true) // 2, because true(boolean) gets type coerced to number 1. 
console.log(2-"2") // 0, "2" gets type coerced to number. 
console.log(2+[]) // 2, because js first convert non-primitive datatypes to strings and then to number. so, therefore empty array gets converted to empty string and then to number which is 0 from empty string. 
console.log(2+{}) // '2[object Object]', because js first convert empty obj to string becoming '[object Object]' and then concatenation occurs.
console.log(2-{}) // NaN, because - operator forces numeric conversion & numeric conversion for empty object is not possible, so NaN. 


// Type Conversion (Explicit conversion)

/* 
-> It is the explicit conversion of a value from one data type to another by the developer.

->  The developer explicitly uses methods like Number(), String(), Boolean(), etc.
