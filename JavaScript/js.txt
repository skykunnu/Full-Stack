# JavaScript was made so that without page refresh or redirection we can change the content. 

# NaN is the only value in js which is not equal to itself. 

# If you have multiple js files in your project , Browsers converts all of them into single js files. 

- for ex- In a HTML doc you have three js files placed in the order(js1,js2,js3) 
js1 contains var fruit='Apple', js2 contains var fruit='Guava', js3 contains console.log(fruit)
what will be the output in the console.

Since browser contains all js files into single js file so, therefore Apple will be 
overwrite by Guava and in the console output will be Guava.
