<!-- CSS: Cascading style sheet -->
<!-- Three ways to apply CSS to HTML
inline CSS: In line with the HTML tag. Fastest, least used. Involves redundancy
internal CSS: not in line but on same page. slower than inline, moderately used. 
external CSS: not on same page, on a different page. Slowest, most used.
-->

<!-- Id & class: are attributes that could be applied on any HTML tag. These are used to make any tag unique. -->

<!-- One page, one id, one time.
 One page, one class, as many times. -->

 <!-- A single tag can have atmost one id.
  A single tag can have as many classes.  -->


<!-- A single HTML tag can have both class & id applied on it. -->

<!-- Id always takes priority over class. -->


<!-- In case of two or more classes, class coming last in CSS will be applied. -->
