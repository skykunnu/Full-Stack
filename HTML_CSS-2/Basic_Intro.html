<!-- HTML - Hypertext Markup Language, Hypertext means text made up of links, markup means language made up of tags 
 In initial days HTML purpose was for documentation.

HTML is a case insensitive language (Both smallcase and uppercase letters are treated equal.)

HTML is a text file which contains tags that eventually makes an UI. 

HTML is a very forgiving langauge. it will render the wrong tags also.  


# 4 reasons to write HTML 

1. HTML provides the foundational structure for web pages. 
2. HTML is a standard markup language for the web, supported by all browsers. 
3. HTML serves as the backbone for adding interactive features via integration of CSS(for styling) and Javascript(for functionality). 
4. Writing HTML with semantic tags ensures content is accessible to screen readers. 

# Format of HTML Page

-> HTML Version
-> Head- Configuration
-> Body- Content



-->
<!-- If you dont include <!DOCTYPE html> in your html file then following things are observed. 
# HTML Version

Open the console and type console.log(document.compatMode): if output is CSS1Compat means the Doctype html is included and if output is BackCompat means the Doctype html is not included. 

1. CSS1Compat=Standard mode (if doctype html is included), Most modern website use this mode, It ensures proper layout and styling according to W3C spec.  
2. BackCompat=Quirks mode  (if doctype html is not included), Used mainly for backward compatibility with old websites. 

The CSS1 and Back compat mode refers to document modes in web browser, which affects how a webpage is rendered. 

3. Visual issues
4. Javascript issues
5. Semantic elements lose their meaning.


# Head 

1. title - basically adds the title to the html doc. 

2. base - the base tag in the head section of html doc sets a default URL that all relative URLs(such as links, images, stylesheets and script) will follow, not the absolute URLs like(https://google.com).

# how base URL works

1. Example without <base>

<a href="about.html">About us <a>

If the current page URL is https://example.com/products/index.html, clicking "About Us" will navigate to:
➡ https://example.com/products/about.html (relative to the current page)


2. Example with <base>

<base href="https://example.com/">

<a href="about.html">About us <a>

    on clicking "About us" it will navigate to  ➡ https://example.com/about.html (relative to the base url.)

3. style - 









4. meta - It is the very powerful tag in entire html file.
